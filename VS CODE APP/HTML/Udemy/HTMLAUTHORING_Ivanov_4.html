        <h1>Sofia, Bulgaria</h1>
        <p>
            I love my home town. It is rather a city, 
            as it is the capital of Bulgaria.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sofia is situated in a field surrounded by mountains, 
            Vitosha being the highest and nearest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Sofia has also a lot of lovely parks. 
            One can engage in sports or seek for artistic occupations of his liking.
