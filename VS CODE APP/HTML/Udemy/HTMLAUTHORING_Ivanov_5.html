            <p><span class ="first">The birds and the bees" may be a emphamism for human reproduction,
                but procreation of actual winged animals is far wilder. 
                This hour, TED speakers explore how birds, bees and bugs multiply.
                 Guests include beekeeper Noah Wilson-Rich, biologist Carin Bondar, 
                 behavioral ecologist Marlene Zuk and comedian Julia Sweeney.></span></p>
