        Our T-shirts are made from 100% premium cotton. They are very comfortable and soft. 
<br><br>
        All our garments are made at a vertically integrated factory in the Western Cape, South Africa. <br> From the sourcing of cotton to the delivery of our garments, we are committed to supporting local.
        
    <br><br>
        All our garments are printed using Direct To Garment (DTG) printing. <br> <br> We use only Eco-Friendly materials and consumables.
        
        The picture is a visual representation of the actual t-shirt. There may be a slight colour/design difference when you receive the actual print.
